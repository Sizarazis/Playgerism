		Go and catch a falling star,
		Get with child a mandrake root,
		Tell me where all past years are,
		Or who cleft the devil's foot,
		Teach me to hear mermaids singing,
		Or to keep off envy's stinging,
		And find
		What wind
		Serves to advance an honest mind.
		If thou be'st born to strange sights,
		Things invisible to see,
		Ride ten thousand days and nights,
		Till age snow white hairs on thee,
		Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,
		All strange wonders that befell thee,
		And swear,
		No where
		Lives a woman true, and fair.
		If thou find'st one, let me know,
		Such a pilgrimage were sweet;
		Yet do not, I would not go,
		Though at next door we might meet;
		Though she were true, when you met her,
		And last, till you write your letter,
		Yet she
		Will be
		False, ere I come, to two, or three.

	lines = {
		Batter my heart, three-person'd God, for you
		As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;
		That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me, and bend
		Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
		I, like an usurp'd town to another due,
		Labor to admit you, but oh, to no end;
		Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,
		But is captiv'd, and proves weak or untrue.
		Yet dearly I love you, and would be lov'd fain,
		But am betroth'd unto your enemy;
		Divorce me, untie or break that knot again,
		Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
		Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
		Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.

	title = A Valediction: Forbidden Mourning
	size = 36
	lines = {
		As virtuous men pass mildly away,
		And whisper to their souls to go,
		Whilst some of their sad friends do say
		The breath goes now, and some say, No:
		So let us melt, and make no noise,
		No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;
		'Twere profanation of our joys
		To tell the laity our love.
		Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears,
		Men reckon what it did, and meant;
		But trepidation of the spheres,
		Though greater far, is innocent.
		Dull sublunary lovers' love
		(Whose soul is sense) cannot admit
		Absence, because it doth remove
		Those things which elemented it.
		But we by a love so much refined,
		That our selves know not what it is,
		Inter-assured of the mind,
		Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.
		Our two souls therefore, which are one,
		Though I must go, endure not yet
		A breach, but an expansion,
		Like gold to airy thinness beat.
		If they be two, they are two so
		As stiff twin compasses are two;
		Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show
		To move, but doth, if the other do.
		And though it in the center sit,
		Yet when the other far doth roam,
		It leans and hearkens after it,
		And grows erect, as that comes home.
		Such wilt thou be to me, who must,
		Like th' other foot, obliquely run;
		Thy firmness makes my circle just,
		And makes me end where I begun.

	title = The Sun Rising

	lines = {
		Busy old fool, unruly sun,
		Why dost thou thus,
		Through windows, and through curtains call on us?
		Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?
		Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide
		Late school boys and sour prentices,
		Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,
		Call country ants to harvest offices,
		Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,
		Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.
		Thy beams, so reverend and strong
		Why shouldst thou think?
		I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,
		But that I would not lose her sight so long;
		If her eyes have not blinded thine,
		Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,
		Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine
		Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.
		Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,
		And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.
		She's all states, and all princes, I,
		Nothing else is.
		Princes do but play us; compared to this,
		All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.
		Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,
		In that the world's contracted thus.
		Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be
		To warm the world, that's done in warming us.
		Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;
		This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.

	lines = {
		For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me love,
		Or chide my palsy, or my gout,
		My five gray hairs, or ruined fortune flout,
		With wealth your state, your mind with arts improve,
		Take you a course, get you a place,
		Observe his honor, or his grace,
		Or the king's real, or his stampèd face
		Contemplate; what you will, approve,
		So you will let me love.
		Alas, alas, who's injured by my love?
		What merchant's ships have my sighs drowned?
		Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?
		When did my colds a forward spring remove?
		When did the heats which my veins fill
		Add one more to the plaguy bill?
		Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still
		Litigious men, which quarrels move,
		Though she and I do love.
		Call us what you will, we are made such by love;
		Call her one, me another fly,
		We're tapers too, and at our own cost die,
		And we in us find the eagle and the dove.
		The phoenix riddle hath more wit
		By us; we two being one, are it.
		So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.
		We die and rise the same, and prove
		Mysterious by this love.
		We can die by it, if not live by love,
		And if unfit for tombs and hearse
		Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;
		And if no piece of chronicle we prove,
		We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;
		As well a well-wrought urn becomes
		The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,
		And by these hymns, all shall approve
		Us canonized for Love.
		And thus invoke us: "You, whom reverend love
		Made one another's hermitage;
		You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;
		Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove
		Into the glasses of your eyes
		(So made such mirrors, and such spies,
		That they did all to you epitomize)
		Countries, towns, courts: beg from above
		A pattern of your love!"

		Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
		Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
		For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
		Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
		From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
		Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,
		And soonest our best men with thee do go,
		Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.
		Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,
		And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,
		And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
		And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?
		One short sleep past, we wake eternally
		And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.

		Mark but this flea, and mark in this,   
		How little that which thou deniest me is;   
		It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,
		And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;   
		Thou know’st that this cannot be said
		A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,
		Yet this enjoys before it woo,
		And pampered swells with one blood made of two,
		And this, alas, is more than we would do.
		Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,
		Where we almost, nay more than married are.   
		This flea is you and I, and this
		Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is;   
		Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met,   
		And cloistered in these living walls of jet.
		Though use make you apt to kill me,
		Let not to that, self-murder added be,
		And sacrilege, three sins in killing three.
		Cruel and sudden, hast thou since
		Purpled thy nail, in blood of innocence?   
		Wherein could this flea guilty be,
		Except in that drop which it sucked from thee?   
		Yet thou triumph’st, and say'st that thou   
		Find’st not thy self, nor me the weaker now;
		’Tis true; then learn how false, fears be:
		Just so much honor, when thou yield’st to me,
		Will waste, as this flea’s death took life from thee.

	lines = {
		I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
		Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?
		But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
		Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den?
		’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.
		If ever any beauty I did see,
		Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.
		And now good-morrow to our waking souls,
		Which watch not one another out of fear;
		For love, all love of other sights controls,
		And makes one little room an everywhere.
		Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,
		Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,
		Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.
		My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,
		And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;
		Where can we find two better hemispheres,
		Without sharp north, without declining west?
		Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;
		If our two loves be one, or, thou and I
		Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.
