		My heart is like a singing bird
        Whose nest is in a water'd shoot;
		My heart is like an apple-tree
        Whose boughs are bent with thickset fruit;
		My heart is like a rainbow shell
        That paddles in a halcyon sea;
		My heart is gladder than all these
        Because my love is come to me.
		Raise me a dais of silk and down;
        Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
		Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
        And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
		Work it in gold and silver grapes,
        In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
		Because the birthday of my life
        Is come, my love is come to me.

	title = In the Bleak Midwinter
	size = 20
	lines = {
		In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
		Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
		Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
		In the bleak midwinter, long ago.
		Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
		Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
		In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
		The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.
		Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,
		Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
		Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,
		The ox and ass and camel which adore.
		Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
		Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
		But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
		Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.
		What can I give Him, poor as I am?
		If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
		If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
		Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.

	title = In An Artist's Studio
	size = 14
	lines = {
		One face looks out from all his canvases,
		One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans:
		We found her hidden just behind those screens,
		That mirror gave back all her loveliness.
		A queen in opal or in ruby dress,
		A nameless girl in freshest summer-greens,
		A saint, an angel — every canvas means
		The same one meaning, neither more or less.
		He feeds upon her face by day and night,
		And she with true kind eyes looks back on him,
		Fair as the moon and joyful as the light:
		Not wan with waiting, not with sorrow dim;
		Not as she is, but was when hope shone bright;
		Not as she is, but as she fills his dream.

	size = 16
	lines = {
		When I am dead, my dearest,
		Sing no sad songs for me;
		Plant thou no roses at my head,
		Nor shady cypress tree:
		Be the green grass above me
		With showers and dewdrops wet;
		And if thou wilt, remember,
		And if thou wilt, forget.
		I shall not see the shadows,
		I shall not feel the rain;
		I shall not hear the nightingale
		Sing on, as if in pain:
		And dreaming through the twilight
		That doth not rise nor set,
		Haply I may remember,
		And haply may forget.

	title = Remember
	size = 14
	lines = {
		Remember me when I am gone away,
        Gone far away into the silent land;
        When you can no more hold me by the hand,
		Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
		Remember me when no more day by day
        You tell me of our future that you plann'd:
        Only remember me; you understand
		It will be late to counsel then or pray.
		Yet if you should forget me for a while
        And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
        For if the darkness and corruption leave
        A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
		Better by far you should forget and smile
        Than that you should remember and be sad.

	title = Winter: My Secret
	size = 34
	lines = {
		I tell my secret? No indeed, not I;
		Perhaps some day, who knows?
		But not today; it froze, and blows and snows,
		And you’re too curious: fie!
		You want to hear it? well:
		Only, my secret’s mine, and I won’t tell.
		Or, after all, perhaps there’s none:
		Suppose there is no secret after all,
		But only just my fun.
		Today’s a nipping day, a biting day;
		In which one wants a shawl,
		A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
		I cannot ope to everyone who taps,
		And let the draughts come whistling thro’ my hall;
		Come bounding and surrounding me,
		Come buffeting, astounding me,
		Nipping and clipping thro’ my wraps and all.
		I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
		His nose to Russian snows
		To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
		You would not peck? I thank you for good will,
		Believe, but leave the truth untested still.
		Spring’s an expansive time: yet I don’t trust
		March with its peck of dust,
		Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
		Nor even May, whose flowers
		One frost may wither thro’ the sunless hours.
		Perhaps some languid summer day,
		When drowsy birds sing less and less,
		And golden fruit is ripening to excess,
		If there’s not too much sun nor too much cloud,
		And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
		Perhaps my secret I may say,
		Or you may guess.
