		I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;
		That only men incredulous of despair,
		Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air
		Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access
		Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,
		In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare
		Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare
		Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express
		Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—
		Most like a monumental statue set
		In everlasting watch and moveless woe
		Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.
		Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:
		If it could weep, it could arise and go.

	size = 14
	lines = {
		How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
		I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
		My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
		For the ends of being and ideal grace.
		I love thee to the level of every day’s
		Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
		I love thee freely, as men strive for right;
		I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
		I love thee with the passion put to use
		In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.
		I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
		With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
		Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
		I shall but love thee better after death.
