	size = 14
	lines = {
		Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,
		But as for me, hélas, I may no more.
		The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,
		I am of them that farthest cometh behind.
		Yet may I by no means my wearied mind
		Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore
		Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,
		Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.
		Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,
		As well as I may spend his time in vain.
		And graven with diamonds in letters plain
		There is written, her fair neck round about:
		Noli me tangere, for Caesar's I am,
		And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.

	title = They Flee From Me
	size = 21
	lines = {
		They flee from me that sometime did me seek
		With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
		I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
		That now are wild and do not remember
		That sometime they put themself in danger
		To take bread at my hand; and now they range,
		Busily seeking with a continual change.
		Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
		Twenty times better; but once in special,
		In thin array after a pleasant guise,
		When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
		And she me caught in her arms long and small;
		Therewithall sweetly did me kiss
		And softly said, “Dear heart, how like you this?”
		It was no dream: I lay broad waking.
		But all is turned thorough my gentleness
		Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
		And I have leave to go of her goodness,
		And she also, to use newfangleness.
		But since that I so kindly am served
		I would fain know what she hath deserved.

		Forget not yet the tried intent
		Of such a truth as I have meant;
		My great travail so gladly spent,
		Forget not yet.
		Forget not yet when first began
		The weary life ye know, since whan
		The suit, the service, none tell can;
		Forget not yet.
		Forget not yet the great assays,
		The cruel wrong, the scornful ways;
		The painful patience in denays,
		Forget not yet.
		Forget not yet, forget not this,
		How long ago hath been and is
		The mind that never meant amiss;
		Forget not yet.
		Forget not then thine own approved,
		The which so long hath thee so loved,
		Whose steadfast faith yet never moved;
		Forget not this.

	title = The Long Love
	size = 14
	lines = {
		The longe love that in my thought doth harbour
		And in mine hert doth keep his residence,
		Into my face presseth with bold pretence
		And therein campeth, spreading his banner.
		She that me learneth to love and suffer
		And will that my trust and lustes negligence
		Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,
		With his hardiness taketh displeasure.
		Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,
		Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,
		And there him hideth and not appeareth.
		What may I do when my master feareth
		But in the field with him to live and die?
		For good is the life ending faithfully.

		And wilt thou leave me thus?
		Say nay, say nay, for shame,
		To save thee from the blame
		Of all my grief and grame;
		And wilt thou leave me thus?
		Say nay, say nay!
		And wilt thou leave me thus,
		That hath loved thee so long
		In wealth and woe among?
		And is thy heart so strong
		As for to leave me thus?
		Say nay, say nay!
		And wilt thou leave me thus,
		That hath given thee my heart
		Never for to depart,
		Nother for pain nor smart;
		And wilt thou leave me thus?
		Say nay, say nay!
		And wilt thou leave me thus
		And have no more pity
		Of him that loveth thee?
		Hélas, thy cruelty!
		And wilt thou leave me thus?
		Say nay, say nay!

	lines = {
		Stand whoso list upon the slipper top
		Of court’s estates, and let me here rejoice;
		And use me quiet without let or stop,
		Unknown in court, that hath such brackish joys:
		In hidden place, so let my days forth pass,
		That when my years be done, withouten noise,
		I may die agèd after the common trace,
		For him death gripeth right hard by the crope
		That is much known of other; and of himself alas,
		Doth die unknown, dazed with dreadful face.
