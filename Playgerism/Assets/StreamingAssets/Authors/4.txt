		No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist
		Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;
		Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd
		By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;
		Make not your rosary of yew-berries,
		Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be
		Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl
		A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;
		For shade to shade will come too drowsily,
		And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.
		But when the melancholy fit shall fall
		Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,
		That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,
		And hides the green hill in an April shroud;
		Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,
		Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,
		Or on the wealth of globed peonies;
		Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,
		Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,
		And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.
		She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;
		And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips
		Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,
		Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:
		Ay, in the very temple of Delight
		Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,
		Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
		Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;
		His soul shalt taste the sadness of her might,
		And be among her cloudy trophies hung.

		Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
		Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
		Conspiring with him how to load and bless
		With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
		To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
		And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
		To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
		With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
		And still more, later flowers for the bees,
		Until they think warm days will never cease,
		For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
		Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
		Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
		Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
		Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
		Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
		Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
		Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
		And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
		Steady thy laden head across a brook;
		Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
		Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.
		Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?
		Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
		While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
		And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
		Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
		Among the river sallows, borne aloft
		Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
		And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
		Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
		The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
		And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

		Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
		Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
		And watching, with eternal lids apart,
		Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,
		The moving waters at their priestlike task
		Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,
		Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
		Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—
		No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
		Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,
		To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
		Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
		Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
		And so live ever—or else swoon to death.

	title = On First Looking into Chapman's Homer
	size = 14
	lines = {
		Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,
		And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
		Round many western islands have I been
		Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
		Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
		That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;
		Yet did I never breathe its pure serene
		Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
		Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
		When a new planet swims into his ken;
		Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
		He star'd at the Pacific—and all his men
		Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—
		Silent, upon a peak in Darien.

	title = La Belle Dame sans Merci
	size = 48
	lines = {
		O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
       	Alone and palely loitering?
		The sedge has withered from the lake,
      	And no birds sing.
		O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
       	So haggard and so woe-begone?
		The squirrel’s granary is full,
    	And the harvest’s done.
		I see a lily on thy brow,
       	With anguish moist and fever-dew,
		And on thy cheeks a fading rose
       	Fast withereth too.
		I met a lady in the meads,
       	Full beautiful—a faery’s child,
		Her hair was long, her foot was light,
       	And her eyes were wild.
		I made a garland for her head,
       	And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;
		She looked at me as she did love,
       	And made sweet moan
		I set her on my pacing steed,
       	And nothing else saw all day long,
		For sidelong would she bend, and sing
       	A faery’s song.
		She found me roots of relish sweet,
       	And honey wild, and manna-dew,
		And sure in language strange she said—
       	‘I love thee true’.
		She took me to her Elfin grot,
       	And there she wept and sighed full sore,
		And there I shut her wild wild eyes
       	With kisses four.
		And there she lullèd me asleep,
       	And there I dreamed—Ah! woe betide!—
		The latest dream I ever dreamt
       	On the cold hill side.
		I saw pale kings and princes too,
       	Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;
		They cried—‘La Belle Dame sans Merci
       	Thee hath in thrall!’
		I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
       	With horrid warning gapèd wide,
		And I awoke and found me here,
       	On the cold hill’s side.
		And this is why I sojourn here,
       	Alone and palely loitering,
		Though the sedge is withered from the lake,
       	And no birds sing.

	lines = {
		Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
		Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
		Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
		A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
		What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
		Of deities or mortals, or of both,
		In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
		What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
		What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
		What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
		Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
		Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
		Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
		Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
		Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
		Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
		Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
		Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
		She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
		For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
		Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
		Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
		And, happy melodist, unwearied,
		For ever piping songs for ever new;
		More happy love! more happy, happy love!
		For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
		For ever panting, and for ever young;
		All breathing human passion far above,
		That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
		A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
		Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
		To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
		Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
		And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
		What little town by river or sea shore,
		Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
		Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
		And, little town, thy streets for evermore
		Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
		Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.
		O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
		Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
		With forest branches and the trodden weed;
		Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
		As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
		When old age shall this generation waste,
		Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
		Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
		"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
		Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

		Byron! how sweetly sad thy melody!
		Attuning still the soul to tenderness,
		As if soft Pity, with unusual stress,
		Had touch'd her plaintive lute, and thou, being by,
		Hadst caught the tones, nor suffer'd them to die.
		O'ershadowing sorrow doth not make thee less
		Delightful: thou thy griefs dost dress
		With a bright halo, shining beamily,
		As when a cloud the golden moon doth veil,
		Its sides are ting'd with a resplendent glow,
		Through the dark robe oft amber rays prevail,
		And like fair veins in sable marble flow;
		Still warble, dying swan! still tell the tale,
		The enchanting tale, the tale of pleasing woe.

		O soft embalmer of the still midnight,
		Shutting, with careful fingers and benign,
		Our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the light,
		Enshaded in forgetfulness divine:
		O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close
		In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes,
		Or wait the "Amen," ere thy poppy throws
		Around my bed its lulling charities.
		Then save me, or the passed day will shine
		Upon my pillow, breeding many woes,—
		Save me from curious Conscience, that still lords
		Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;
		Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards,
		And seal the hushed Casket of my Soul.

	lines = {
		My spirit is too weak—mortality
		Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
		And each imagined pinnacle and steep
		Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
		Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
		Yet ’tis a gentle luxury to weep
		That I have not the cloudy winds to keep
		Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye.
		Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
		Bring round the heart an undescribable feud;
		So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
		That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
		Wasting of old time—with a billowy main—
		A sun—a shadow of a magnitude.
