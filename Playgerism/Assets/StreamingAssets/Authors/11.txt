		My heart leaps up when I behold 
		A rainbow in the sky:
		So was it when my life began; 
		So is it now I am a man; 
		So be it when I shall grow old, 
		Or let me die!
		The Child is father of the Man;
		And I could wish my days to be
		Bound each to each by natural piety.

	size = 14
	lines = {
		Earth has not any thing to show more fair:
		Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
		A sight so touching in its majesty:
		This City now doth, like a garment, wear
		The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
		Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
		Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
		All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
		Never did sun more beautifully steep
		In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
		Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
		The river glideth at his own sweet will:
		Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;
		And all that mighty heart is lying still!

	title = I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud
	size = 24
	lines = {
		I wandered lonely as a cloud
		That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
		When all at once I saw a crowd,
		A host, of golden daffodils;
		Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
		Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
		Continuous as the stars that shine
		And twinkle on the milky way,
		They stretched in never-ending line
		Along the margin of a bay:
		Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
		Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
		The waves beside them danced; but they
		Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
		A poet could not but be gay,
		In such a jocund company:
		I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
		What wealth the show to me had brought:
		For oft, when on my couch I lie
		In vacant or in pensive mood,
		They flash upon that inward eye
		Which is the bliss of solitude;
		And then my heart with pleasure fills,
		And dances with the daffodils.

	lines = {
		Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour:
		England hath need of thee: she is a fen
		Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,
		Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,
		Have forfeited their ancient English dower
		Of inward happiness. We are selfish men;
		Oh! raise us up, return to us again;
		And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.
		Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart:
		Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:
		Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,
		So didst thou travel on life's common way,
		In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart
		The lowliest duties on herself did lay.

	size = 8
	lines = {
		A slumber did my spirit seal;
		I had no human fears:
		She seemed a thing that could not feel
		The touch of earthly years.
		No motion has she now, no force;
		She neither hears nor sees;
		Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,
		With rocks, and stones, and trees.

	title = The Solitary Reaper
	size = 32
	lines = {
		Behold her, single in the field,
		Yon solitary Highland Lass!
		Reaping and singing by herself;
		Stop here, or gently pass!
		Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
		And sings a melancholy strain;
		O listen! for the Vale profound
		Is overflowing with the sound.
		No Nightingale did ever chaunt
		More welcome notes to weary bands
		Of travellers in some shady haunt,
		Among Arabian sands:
		A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
		In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,
		Breaking the silence of the seas
		Among the farthest Hebrides.
		Will no one tell me what she sings?—
		Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
		For old, unhappy, far-off things,
		And battles long ago:
		Or is it some more humble lay,
		Familiar matter of to-day?
		Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
		That has been, and may be again?
		Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang
		As if her song could have no ending;
		I saw her singing at her work,
		And o'er the sickle bending;—
		I listened, motionless and still;
		And, as I mounted up the hill,
		The music in my heart I bore,
		Long after it was heard no more.

	title = Surprised by Joy
	size = 14
	lines = {
		Surprised by joy—impatient as the Wind
		I turned to share the transport—Oh! with whom
		But Thee, long buried in the silent Tomb,
		That spot which no vicissitude can find?
		Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind—
		But how could I forget thee?—Through what power,
		Even for the least division of an hour,
		Have I been so beguiled as to be blind
		To my most grievous loss!—That thought’s return
		Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,
		Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,
		Knowing my heart’s best treasure was no more;
		That neither present time, nor years unborn
		Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.

	size = 14
	lines = {
		It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,
		The holy time is quiet as a Nun
		Breathless with adoration; the broad sun
		Is sinking down in its tranquility;
		The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea;
		Listen! the mighty Being is awake,
		And doth with his eternal motion make
		A sound like thunder—everlastingly.
		Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,
		If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,
		Thy nature is not therefore less divine:
		Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;
		And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,
		God being with thee when we know it not.
