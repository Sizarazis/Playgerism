	size = 9
	lines = {
		I weep for Adonais—he is dead!
		Oh, weep for Adonais! though our tears
		Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head!
		And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years
		To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,
		And teach them thine own sorrow, say: "With me
		Died Adonais; till the Future dares
		Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be
		An echo and a light unto eternity!

	title = Hellas: Chorus
	size = 42
	lines = {
		The world's great age begins anew,
        	The golden years return,
		The earth doth like a snake renew
        	Her winter weeds outworn:
		Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam
		Like wrecks of a dissolving dream.
		A brighter Hellas rears its mountains
        	From waves serener far;
		A new Peneus rolls his fountains
      		Against the morning star.
		Where fairer Tempes bloom, there sleep
		Young Cyclads on a sunnier deep.
		A loftier Argo cleaves the main,
        	Fraught with a later prize;
		Another Orpheus sings again,
        	And loves, and weeps, and dies.
		A new Ulysses leaves once more
		Calypso for his native shore.
		Oh, write no more the tale of Troy,
        	If earth Death's scroll must be!
		Nor mix with Laian rage the joy
        	Which dawns upon the free:
		Although a subtler Sphinx renew
		Riddles of death Thebes never knew.
		Another Athens shall arise,
        	And to remoter time
		Bequeath, like sunset to the skies,
        	The splendour of its prime;
		And leave, if nought so bright may live,
		All earth can take or Heaven can give.
		Saturn and Love their long repose
        	Shall burst, more bright and good
		Than all who fell, than One who rose,
        	Than many unsubdu'd:
		Not gold, not blood, their altar dowers,
		But votive tears and symbol flowers.
		Oh cease! must hate and death return?
        	Cease! must men kill and die?
		Cease! drain not to its dregs the urn
        	Of bitter prophecy.
		The world is weary of the past,
		Oh might it die or rest at last!

	title = Ozymandias
	size = 14
	lines = {
		I met a traveller from an antique land,
		Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
		Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
		Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
		And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
		Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
		Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
		The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
		And on the pedestal, these words appear:
		My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
		Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
		Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
		Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
		The lone and level sands stretch far away.

	title = England in 1819
	size = 14
	lines = {
		An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying King;
		Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow
		Through public scorn,—mud from a muddy spring;
		Rulers who neither see nor feel nor know,
		But leechlike to their fainting country cling
		Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow.
		A people starved and stabbed in th' untilled field;
		An army, whom liberticide and prey
		Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield;
		Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;
		Religion Christless, Godless—a book sealed;
		A senate, Time’s worst statute, unrepealed—
		Are graves from which a glorious Phantom may
		Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day.

		I
		Art thou pale for weariness
		Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
		Wandering companionless
		Among the stars that have a different birth, —
		And ever changing, like a joyless eye
		That finds no object worth its constancy?
		II
		Thou chosen sister of the Spirit,
		That gazes on thee till in thee it pities ...

	title = Music when Soft Voices Die (To--)
	size = 10
	lines = {
		I
		Music, when soft voices die,
		Vibrates in the memory—
		Odours, when sweet violets sicken,
		Live within the sense they quicken.
		Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,
		Are heaped for the belovèd's bed;
		II
		And so thy thoughts, when thou art gone,
		Love itself shall slumber on.
