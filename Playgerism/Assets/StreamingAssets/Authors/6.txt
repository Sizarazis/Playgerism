	lines = {
		What needs my Shakespeare, for his honoured bones,
		The labour of an age in pilèd stones?
		Or that his hollowed relics should be hid
		Under a stary-pointing pyramid?
		Dear son of Memory, great heir of Fame,
		What need’st thou such weak witness of thy name?
		Thou, in our wonder and astonishment,
		Hast built thyself a livelong monument.
		For whilst, to the shame of slow-endeavouring art,
		Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart
		Hath, from the leaves of thy unvalued book,
		Those Delphic lines with deep impression took;
		Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving,
		Dost make us marble, with too much conceiving;
		And, so sepulchred, in such pomp dost lie,
		That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.

	title = On His Deceased Wife
	size = 14
	lines = {
		Methought I saw my late espoused saint
        Brought to me, like Alcestis, from the grave,
        Whom Jove's great son to her glad husband gave,
        Rescu'd from death by force, though pale and faint.
		Mine, as whom wash'd from spot of child-bed taint
        Purification in the old Law did save,
        And such as yet once more I trust to have
        Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint,
		Came vested all in white, pure as her mind;
        Her face was veil'd, yet to my fancied sight
        Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shin'd
		So clear as in no face with more delight.
        But Oh! as to embrace me she inclin'd,
        I wak'd, she fled, and day brought back my night.

	lines = {
		Now the bright morning-star, Day’s harbinger,
		Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her
		The flowery May, who from her green lap throws
		The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose.
		Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire
		Mirth, and youth, and warm desire!
		Woods and groves are of thy dressing;
		Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing.
		Thus we salute thee with our early song,
		And welcome thee, and wish thee long.

	lines = {
		How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
        Stol'n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!
        My hasting days fly on with full career,
        But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.
		Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth
        That I to manhood am arriv'd so near;
        And inward ripeness doth much less appear,
        That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.
		Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,
        It shall be still in strictest measure ev'n
        To that same lot, however mean or high,
		Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heav'n:
        All is, if I have grace to use it so
        As ever in my great Task-Master's eye.

	title = To Cyriack Skinner
	size = 14
	lines = {
		Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench
		Of British Themis, with no mean applause,
		Pronounced, and in his volumes taught, our laws,
		Which others at their bar so often wrench,
		To-day deep thoughts resolve with me to drench
		In mirth that after no repenting draws;
		Let Euclid rest, and Archimedes pause,
		And what the Swede intend, and what the French.
		To measure life learn thou betimes, and know
		Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;
		For other things mild Heaven a time ordains,
		And disapproves that care, though wise in show,
		That with superfluous burden loads the day,
		And, when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.

	title = On His Blindness
	size = 14
	lines = {
		When I consider how my light is spent
		Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
		And that one Talent which is death to hide
		Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
		To serve therewith my Maker, and present
		My true account, lest He returning chide,
		“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”
		I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent
		That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need
		Either man’s work or his own gifts. Who best
		Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
		Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,
		And post o’er land and ocean without rest;
		They also serve who only stand and wait.
