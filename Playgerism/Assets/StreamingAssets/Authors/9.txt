		And did those feet in ancient time
		Walk upon Englands mountains green:
		And was the holy Lamb of God,
		On Englands pleasant pastures seen!
		And did the Countenance Divine,
		Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
		And was Jerusalem builded here,
		Among these dark Satanic Mills?
		Bring me my Bow of burning gold:
		Bring me my arrows of desire:
		Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold!
		Bring me my Chariot of fire!
		I will not cease from Mental Fight,
		Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand:
		Till we have built Jerusalem,
		In Englands green & pleasant Land.

	lines = {
		I wander thro' each charter'd street,
		Near where the charter'd Thames does flow. 
		And mark in every face I meet
		Marks of weakness, marks of woe.
		In every cry of every Man,
		In every Infants cry of fear,
		In every voice: in every ban,
		The mind-forg'd manacles I hear 
		How the Chimney-sweepers cry
		Every blackning Church appalls, 
		And the hapless Soldiers sigh
		Runs in blood down Palace walls 
		But most thro' midnight streets I hear
		How the youthful Harlots curse
		Blasts the new-born Infants tear 
		And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse

		O Rose thou art sick. 
		The invisible worm, 
		That flies in the night 
		In the howling storm: 
		Has found out thy bed
		Of crimson joy:
		And his dark secret love
		Does thy life destroy.

	lines = {
		I was angry with my friend; 
		I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
		I was angry with my foe: 
		I told it not, my wrath did grow. 
		And I waterd it in fears,
		Night & morning with my tears: 
		And I sunned it with smiles,
		And with soft deceitful wiles. 
		And it grew both day and night. 
		Till it bore an apple bright. 
		And my foe beheld it shine,
		And he knew that it was mine. 
		And into my garden stole, 
		When the night had veild the pole; 
		In the morning glad I see; 
		My foe outstretched beneath the tree.

		Tyger Tyger, burning bright, 
		In the forests of the night; 
		What immortal hand or eye, 
		Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
		In what distant deeps or skies. 
		Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
		On what wings dare he aspire?
		What the hand, dare seize the fire?
		And what shoulder, & what art,
		Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
		And when thy heart began to beat,
		What dread hand? & what dread feet?
		What the hammer? what the chain, 
		In what furnace was thy brain?
		What the anvil? what dread grasp, 
		Dare its deadly terrors clasp! 
		When the stars threw down their spears 
		And water'd heaven with their tears: 
		Did he smile his work to see?
		Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
		Tyger Tyger burning bright, 
		In the forests of the night: 
		What immortal hand or eye,
		Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

		"Love seeketh not itself to please,
		Nor for itself hath any care,
		But for another gives its ease,
		And builds a Heaven in Hell's despair."
		So sung a little Clod of Clay
		Trodden with the cattle's feet,
		But a Pebble of the brook
		Warbled out these metres meet:
		"Love seeketh only self to please,
		To bind another to its delight,
		Joys in another's loss of ease,
		And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite."

		Little Lamb who made thee 
		Dost thou know who made thee 
		Gave thee life & bid thee feed. 
		By the stream & o'er the mead;
		Gave thee clothing of delight,
		Softest clothing wooly bright;
		Gave thee such a tender voice,
		Making all the vales rejoice! 
		Little Lamb who made thee 
		Dost thou know who made thee 
		Little Lamb I'll tell thee,
		Little Lamb I'll tell thee!
		He is called by thy name,
		For he calls himself a Lamb: 
		He is meek & he is mild, 
		He became a little child: 
		I a child & thou a lamb, 
		We are called by his name.
		Little Lamb God bless thee. 
		Little Lamb God bless thee.

	lines = {
		I went to the Garden of Love,
		And saw what I never had seen:
		A Chapel was built in the midst,
		Where I used to play on the green.
		And the gates of this Chapel were shut,
		And Thou shalt not. writ over the door;
		So I turn'd to the Garden of Love,
		That so many sweet flowers bore. 
		And I saw it was filled with graves,
		And tomb-stones where flowers should be:
		And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,
		And binding with briars, my joys & desires.

	size = 12
	lines = {
		Never seek to tell thy love
		Love that never told can be 
		For the gentle wind does move
		Silently invisibly
		I told my love I told my love 
		I told her all my heart 
		Trembling cold in ghastly fears
		Ah she doth depart
		Soon as she was gone from me
		A traveller came by
		Silently invisibly 
		O was no deny
