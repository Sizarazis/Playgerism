		I hid my heart in a nest of roses,
		Out of the sun’s way, hidden apart;
		In a softer bed than the soft white snow’s is,
		Under the roses I hid my heart.
		Why would it sleep not? why should it start,
		When never a leaf of the rose-tree stirred?
		What made sleep flutter his wings and part?
		Only the song of a secret bird.
		Lie still, I said, for the wind’s wing closes,
		And mild leaves muffle the keen sun’s dart;
		Life still, for the wind of the warm sea dozes,
		And the wind is unquieter yet than thou art.
		Does a thought in thee still as a thorn’s wound smart?
		Does the fang still fret thee of hope deferred?
		What bids the lids of thy sleep dispart?
		Only the song of a secret bird.
		The green land’s name that a charm encloses,
		It never was writ in the traveller’s chart,
		And sweet as the fruit on its tree that grows is,
		It never was sold in the merchant’s mart.
		The swallows of dreams through its dim fields dart,
		And sleep’s are the tunes in its tree tops heard;
		No hound’s note wakens the wildwood hart,
		Only the song of a secret bird.
		ENVOI
		In the world of dreams I have chosen my part,
		To sleep for a season and hear no word
		Of true love’s truth or of light love’s art,
		Only the song of a secret bird.

		O heart of hearts, the chalice of love's fire,
		Hid round with flowers and all the bounty of bloom;
		O wonderful and perfect heart, for whom
		The lyrist liberty made life a lyre;
		O heavenly heart, at whose most dear desire
		Dead love, living and singing, cleft his tomb,
		And with him risen and regent in death's room
		All day thy choral pulses rang full choir;
		O heart whose beating blood was running song,
		O sole thing sweeter than thine own songs were,
		Help us for thy free love's sake to be free,
		True for thy truth's sake, for thy strength's sake strong,
		Till very liberty make clean and fair
		The nursing earth as the sepulchral sea.
