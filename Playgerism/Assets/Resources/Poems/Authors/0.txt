		FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,
		That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
		But as the riper should by time decease,
		His tender heir might bear his memory:
		But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
		Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
		Making a famine where abundance lies,
		Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
		Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
		And only herald to the gaudy spring,
		Within thine own bud buriest thy content
		And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
		Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
		To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

		When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
		And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
		Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
		Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
		Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
		Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
		To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
		Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
		How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
		If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
		Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
		Proving his beauty by succession thine!
		This were to be new made when thou art old,
		And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

		Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
		Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
		Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
		And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
		Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
		And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
		And every fair from fair sometime declines,
		By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
		But thy eternal summer shall not fade
		Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
		Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
		When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
		So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
		So long lives this and this gives life to thee.

		When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
		I summon up remembrance of things past,
		I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
		And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
		Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
		For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
		And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
		And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
		Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
		And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
		The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
		Which I new pay as if not paid before.
		But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
		All losses are restored and sorrows end.

		Full many a glorious morning have I seen
		Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
		Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
		Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
		Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
		With ugly rack on his celestial face,
		And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
		Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
		Even so my sun one early morn did shine
		With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
		But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
		The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
		Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
		Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.

		That time of year thou mayst in me behold
		When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
		Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
		Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
		In me thou seest the twilight of such day
		As after sunset fadeth in the west,
		Which by and by black night doth take away,
		Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
		In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
		That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
		As the death-bed whereon it must expire
		Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.
		This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
		To love that well which thou must leave ere long.

		To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
		For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
		Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
		Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
		Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
		In process of the seasons have I seen,
		Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
		Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
		Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
		Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
		So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
		Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
		For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;
		Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
