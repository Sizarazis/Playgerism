		The buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yard
		And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,
		Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.
		And from there those that lifted eyes could count
		Five mountain ranges one behind the other
		Under the sunset far into Vermont.
		And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,
		As it ran light, or had to bear a load.
		And nothing happened: day was all but done.
		Call it a day, I wish they might have said
		To please the boy by giving him the half hour
		That a boy counts so much when saved from work.
		His sister stood beside him in her apron
		To tell them ‘Supper.’ At the word, the saw,
		As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,
		Leaped out at the boy’s hand, or seemed to leap—
		He must have given the hand. However it was,
		Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!
		The boy’s first outcry was a rueful laugh,
		As he swung toward them holding up the hand
		Half in appeal, but half as if to keep
		The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all—
		Since he was old enough to know, big boy
		Doing a man’s work, though a child at heart—
		He saw all spoiled. ‘Don’t let him cut my hand off—
		The doctor, when he comes. Don’t let him, sister!’
		So. But the hand was gone already.
		The doctor put him in the dark of ether.
		He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.
		And then—the watcher at his pulse took fright.
		No one believed. They listened at his heart.
		Little—less—nothing!—and that ended it.
		No more to build on there. And they, since they
		Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.

		Whose woods these are I think I know.   
		His house is in the village though;   
		He will not see me stopping here   
		To watch his woods fill up with snow.   
		My little horse must think it queer   
		To stop without a farmhouse near   
		Between the woods and frozen lake   
		The darkest evening of the year.   
		He gives his harness bells a shake   
		To ask if there is some mistake.   
		The only other sound’s the sweep   
		Of easy wind and downy flake.   
		The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
		But I have promises to keep,   
		And miles to go before I sleep,   
		And miles to go before I sleep.

		I have been one acquainted with the night.
		I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.
		I have outwalked the furthest city light.
		I have looked down the saddest city lane.
		I have passed by the watchman on his beat
		And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.
		I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
		When far away an interrupted cry
		Came over houses from another street,
		But not to call me back or say good-bye;
		And further still at an unearthly height,
		One luminary clock against the sky
		Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right. 
		I have been one acquainted with the night.

		Some say the world will end in fire,
		Some say in ice.
		From what I’ve tasted of desire
		I hold with those who favor fire.
		But if it had to perish twice,
		I think I know enough of hate
		To say that for destruction ice
		Is also great
		And would suffice.

		There was never a sound beside the wood but one,
		And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.
		What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;
		Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,
		Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound—
		And that was why it whispered and did not speak.
		It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,
		Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:
		Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
		To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,
		Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
		(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.
		The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.
		My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.

	title = The Road Not Taken
	size = 20
	lines = {
		Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
		And sorry I could not travel both
		And be one traveler, long I stood
		And looked down one as far as I could
		To where it bent in the undergrowth;
		Then took the other, as just as fair,
		And having perhaps the better claim,
		Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
		Though as for that the passing there
		Had worn them really about the same,
		And both that morning equally lay
		In leaves no step had trodden black.
		Oh, I kept the first for another day!
		Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
		I doubted if I should ever come back.
		I shall be telling this with a sigh
		Somewhere ages and ages hence:
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
		I took the one less traveled by,
		And that has made all the difference.

		Nature’s first green is gold,
		Her hardest hue to hold.
		Her early leaf’s a flower;
		But only so an hour.
		Then leaf subsides to leaf.
		So Eden sank to grief,
		So dawn goes down to day.
		Nothing gold can stay.

		The land was ours before we were the land’s.
		She was our land more than a hundred years
		Before we were her people. She was ours
		In Massachusetts, in Virginia,
		But we were England’s, still colonials,
		Possessing what we still were unpossessed by,
		Possessed by what we now no more possessed.
		Something we were withholding made us weak
		Until we found out that it was ourselves
		We were withholding from our land of living,
		And forthwith found salvation in surrender.
		Such as we were we gave ourselves outright
		(The deed of gift was many deeds of war)
		To the land vaguely realizing westward,
		But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced,
		Such as she was, such as she would become.
