		Wee, sleeket, cowran, tim’rous beastie,
		O, what a panic’s in thy breastie!
		Thou need na start awa sae hasty,
		Wi’ bickerin brattle!
		I wad be laith to rin an’ chase thee
		Wi’ murd’ring pattle!
		I’m truly sorry Man’s dominion
		Has broken Nature’s social union,
		An’ justifies that ill opinion,
		Which makes thee startle,
		At me, thy poor, earth-born companion,
		An’ fellow-mortal!
		I doubt na, whyles, but thou may thieve;
		What then? poor beastie, thou maun live!
		A daimen-icker in a thrave
		’S a sma’ request:
		I’ll get a blessin wi’ the lave,
		An’ never miss ’t!
		Thy wee-bit housie, too, in ruin!
		It’s silly wa’s the win’s are strewin!
		An’ naething, now, to big a new ane,
		O’ foggage green!
		An’ bleak December’s winds ensuin,
		Baith snell an’ keen!
		Thou saw the fields laid bare an’ waste,
		An’ weary Winter comin fast,
		An’ cozie here, beneath the blast,
		Thou thought to dwell,
		Till crash! the cruel coulter past
		Out thro’ thy cell.
		That wee-bit heap o’ leaves an’ stibble
		Has cost thee monie a weary nibble!
		Now thou’s turn’d out, for a’ thy trouble,
		But house or hald,
		To thole the Winter’s sleety dribble,
		An’ cranreuch cauld!
		But Mousie, thou art no thy-lane,
		In proving foresight may be vain:
		The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men
		Gang aft agley,
		An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,
		For promis’d joy!
		Still, thou art blest, compar’d wi’ me!
		The present only toucheth thee:
		But Och! I backward cast my e’e,
		On prospects drear!
		An’ forward tho’ I canna see,
		I guess an’ fear!

		Ye flowery banks o' bonie Doon,
        How can ye blume sae fair?
		How can ye chant, ye little birds,
        And I sae fu' o' care?
		Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
        That sings upon the bough;
		Thou minds me o' the happy days,
        When my fause love was true.
		Thou'll break my heart, thou bonie bird,
        That sings beside thy mate;
		For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
        And wist na o' my fate.
		Aft hae I rov'd by bonie Doon
        To see the wood-bine twine,
		And ilka bird sang o' its luve,
        And sae did I o' mine.
		Wi' lightsome heart I pu'd a rose
        Frae aff its thorny tree;
		And my fause luver staw my rose
        But left the thorn wi' me.

		John Anderson my jo, John,
		When we were first acquent,
		Your locks were like the raven,
		Your bonie brow was brent;
		But now your brow is beld, John,
		Your locks are like the snaw,
		but blessings on your frosty pow,
		John Anderson, my jo!
		John Anderson my jo, John,
		We clamb the hill thegither,
		And monie a cantie day, John,
		We've had wi' ane anither;
		Now we maun totter down, John,
		And hand in hand we'll go,
		And sleep thegither at the foot,
		John Anderson, my jo!

	lines = {
		O my Luve is like a red, red rose
		That’s newly sprung in June;
		O my Luve is like the melody
		That’s sweetly played in tune.
		So fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
		So deep in luve am I;
		And I will luve thee still, my dear,
		Till a’ the seas gang dry.
		Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
		And the rocks melt wi’ the sun;
		I will love thee still, my dear,
		While the sands o’ life shall run.
		And fare thee weel, my only luve!
		And fare thee weel awhile!
		And I will come again, my luve,
		Though it were ten thousand mile.
