A poem puzzle game.


### Description
Players will choose a poem from the main menu.  </br>
They will then be given a scrambled version of that poem.  </br>
They will move around the lines of the poem until they have completely unscrambled the poem.  </br>
The player will be notified when 2 lines are matching up, and those lines will be locked. This should indicate progress like 2 puzzle pieces matching up.  </br>
The lines may also be coloured different, and an animation pops up when a match occurs.  </br>
The players are scored based on a timer.  </br>


*Optional*

Free Mode: The player will select a poem and be given its lines scrambled. They will then move the lines around however they wish.  </br>
I think this mode might be fun if people want to make a different poem from the source lines.  </br>

### To Do
1. Build the poem database
2. Colour the line links uniquely (make it look like a rainbow at the start!)
3. Animations
4. Art
5. IPhone and Android integration

### Bugs and Issues
- Horizontal text overflowing isn't handled
- Vertical scrolling bugged
- Need to check device OS to set and get local location of files in the project.
- Screen regions will be an issue (see how badly it fails when I test with phones)
