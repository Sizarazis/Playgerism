A poem puzzle game.


### Description
Players will choose a poem from the main menu.  </br>
They will then be given a scrambled version of that poem.  </br>
They will move around the lines of the poem until they have completely unscrambled the poem.  </br>
The player will be notified when lines are matching up, and they will then be locked. This should indicate progress like puzzle pieces matching up.  </br>
The players are scored based on a timer.  </br>

### To Do
1. IPhone and Android integration
2. Unity Ads integration
3. Add the 'Legal' and 'Help' text.
4. Animations
5. Art

### Bugs and Issues
- Some text horizontally stretches according to the width of the screen. 

### Moving Forward
- OnMouseUp(), OnMouseDown(), OnMouseDrag() are used when I should really use a better mobile system.
- Build the poem database
- Add the "Free Mode" -- See "Free Mode Idea" below
- Make the scoring system more robust
- Colour line links uniquely
- Alphabetize authors and titles in the the selection screen.
- Make the 'Best Times' screen prettier and more organized.

*Free Mode Idea*

Free Mode: The player will select a poem and be given its lines scrambled. They will then move the lines around however they wish.  </br>
I think this mode might be fun if people want to make a different poem from the source lines.  </br>
