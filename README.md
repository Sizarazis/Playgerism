# Playgerism
A poem puzzle game.


### Description
Players will choose a poem from the main menu. 
They will then be given a scrambled version of that poem. 
They will move around the lines of the poem until they have completely unscrambled the poem. 
The player will be notified when 2 lines are matching up, and those lines will be locked. This should indicate progress like 2 puzzle pieces matching up.
The lines may also be coloured different, and an animation pops up when a match occurs.
The players are scored based on a timer.


*Optional*

Free Mode: The player will select a poem and be given its lines scrambled. They will then move the lines around however they wish.
I think this mode might be fun if people want to make a different poem from the source lines.

### To Do
- Test the game with some poems to see if the rules work well
- Colour links
- End the game upon completion of the poem
- Menus
- Animations
